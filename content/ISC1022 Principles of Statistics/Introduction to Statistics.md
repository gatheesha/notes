# What is Statistics
Statistics has been defined differently by different authors from time to time.

“Statistics is the science of **collecting**, **organizing**, **analyzing**, **presenting**, and **interpreting** **data** to make decisions and solve problems.” - Croxton and Cowden
## Different formats of data
- Tabular data
- Image data
- Audio data
- Video data
## Data Modalities (Mixture of data)

| Data Type   | Description                            | Examples                                   |
|------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Text       | Written characters                      | Articles, reports                          |
| Numeric    | Quantitative values                     | Sales figures, temperatures                |
| Image      | Visual data                             | X-rays, satellite images                   |
| Audio      | Sound data                              | Recorded interviews, music                 |
| Video      | Moving visual media                     | Surveillance footage, sports replays       |
| Multimodal | Combination of two or more data formats | Audio + video (films), text + image (PDFs) |

## **Collecting** Data
- **Data collection** is the foundation of statistical analysis.
- If data are faulty, the conclusions drawn are not reliable.
- Good data can be analyzed and summarized to obtain useful information.
- Bad data can also be analyzed and summarized. But it provides incorrect or non informative information.
### Metrics used to decide quality of Data
- **Reliable** - The consistency and trustworthiness of data.
- **Accurate** - The degree to which data is correct and free from errors.
- **Relevant** - The degree to which data provides insight into the problem in hand or purpose or the study.
## **Organizing** Data
Once you collect the data we need to organize and store data in a way such that it is easier to analyze
> [!example]
> A study is conducted to determine the academic performance of first year FOT undergraduates in USJ.
## **Analyzing** Data
- Involves examining and processing the data to uncover patterns and trends.
- Can include statistical modeling, correlation, regression analysis, and hypothesis testing.
- Tools: Excel, R, Python (pandas, NumPy), SPSS, etc.
- Goal: Extract meaningful insights to support decision-making.
## **Presenting and Interpreting** Data
- Presenting: Graphs, charts, tables, dashboards, and reports to visually communicate data.
- Interpreting: Drawing conclusions and making informed decisions based on presented data.
- Helps stakeholders understand key messages.
- Visualization tools: Excel, Tableau, Power BI, Matplotlib, etc.
# Why Statistics
> "The best thing about being a statistician is that you get to play in everyone's backyard" - John Tukey

## Applications of Statistics
### In Economics
- Wages, prices, time series analysis, demand forecasting.
- Data analysis helps in policymaking and economic planning.
### In Industry
- Used in **Quality Control**: inspection plans, control charts, defect tracking.
- Determines product conformity to specifications.
### In Biology
- Epidemiology: Study of disease patterns and causes.
- Biostatistics: Statistical analysis of biological data.
### In Sports
- Evaluates performance: batting average, win probability, expected goals (xG).
- Helps in team strategy and player analysis.
# When to do statistics, Before or After?
> "To consult the statistician after an experiment is finished is often merely to ask him to conduct a post mortem examination. He can perhaps say what the experiment died of."

# Functions of Statistics
• Simplifies complexity
• Facilitates comparison
• Presents facts in a definite form
• Investigates trends
• Helps in forecasting
• Helps in formulating and testing hypothesis
• Facilitates to design experiments

## Scope of Statistics

Statistics is a branch of mathematics that deals with the collection, organization, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of data. It is used in a wide variety of fields, including:

- **Science:** Statistics is used to design experiments, analyze data, and draw conclusions about the natural world.
- **Business:** Statistics is used to market products, track sales, and make financial decisions.
- **Government:** Statistics is used to track economic trends, measure the effectiveness of government programs, and allocate resources.
- **Healthcare:** Statistics is used to develop new drugs, track the spread of diseases, and assess the effectiveness of medical treatments.
- **Sports:** Statistics is used to analyze player performance, scout new talent, and predict the outcome of games.
## Limitations of Statistics

While statistics is a powerful tool, it is important to be aware of its limitations. Some of the most important limitations include:

- **Data quality:** Garbage in – garbage out (GIGO) - The quality of statistical analysis is limited by the quality of the data. If the data is inaccurate, incomplete, or biased, the results of the analysis will also be inaccurate, incomplete, or biased.
- **Sampling:** Statistics is often based on samples of data rather than the entire population. This means that the results of the analysis may not be generalizable to the entire population.
- **Assumptions:** Statistical methods often rely on assumptions about the data, such as the assumption that the data is normally distributed. If these assumptions are not met, the results of the analysis may be misleading.
> [!example]
> "A factory produces 10% defective bulbs."
> 
This does not mean that if we check 10 bulbs, exactly one will be
defective. In reality, we might find none, or we might find more
than one. The statement simply means that over a large number
of bulbs produced, about 10% will be defective on average.

- **Causation vs. Correlation:** Statistics can show that two variables are correlated, but it cannot prove that one variable causes the other.
- **Misinterpretation:** Statistics can be misused or misinterpreted, leading to false conclusions.
- Conclusions are given for a homogeneous group (not for
individuals)
Ex :- Calculating average of Bananas and Mangos.
> [!example]
> "The number of pedestrian accidents taking place in the middle of the road is much less than the number of accidents taking place on 'its side. Hence it is safer to walk in the middle of the road."


# Branches of Statistics
There are 2 types of statistics:
- Descriptive statistics
- Inferential statistics
## Descriptive statistics?????
Descriptive statistics uses data that describes the population either through numerical calculated graphs or tables. It provides a graphical summary of data.
It is simply used for summarizing objects, etc. There are two categories in this as follows.

- Measure of Central Tendency
- Measure of Variability

## Inferential statistics???????
Drawing right conclusions from statistical analyzing
- Regression analysis
- Hypothesis testing


# Classification of Data
## Types of Data
- Data
	 - Qualitative
		 - Nominal - No order (e.g., colors)
		 - Ordinal - With order (e.g., satisfaction levels)
	 - Quantitative
		 - Discrete - Measurable (e.g., weight, height)
		 - Continuous - Countable (e.g., number of students)
