## What is Workplace Ethics?
Workplace ethics refers to the moral principles and values that guide behavior, interactions, and decision-making within a professional setting. It involves applying ethical standards to work-related situations and fostering a culture of integrity and professionalism within an organization.

A strong ethical culture contributes to organizational success by promoting fairness, accountability, and respect among employees.

## Characteristics of Good Workplace Ethics
1. **Integrity**  
   Acting with honesty and consistency, even when no one is watching. Maintaining trustworthiness in all professional activities.
2. **Respect**  
   Acknowledging the dignity, rights, and contributions of others. Treating everyone fairly regardless of their role or background.
3. **Fairness**  
   Ensuring equal treatment and opportunities without favoritism or bias. Upholding justice in decision-making.
4. **Confidentiality**  
   Safeguarding sensitive information related to employees, customers, and the organization.
5. **Accountability**  
   Taking responsibility for one's actions and decisions. Owning up to mistakes and learning from them.
6. **Professionalism**  
   Demonstrating competence, reliability, and courtesy in all workplace interactions.
7. **Conflict of Interest**  
   Avoiding situations where personal interests conflict with professional responsibilities.
8. **Compliance**  
   Following company policies, procedures, legal regulations, and industry standards.

## Addressing Ethical Issues in the Workplace
Ethical challenges such as conflicts, complaints, misconduct, and work-related accidents are inevitable in modern workplaces, especially with the presence of multiple generations who may hold differing views on ethics.

- Writing standards of ethical workspace conduct
- Training ethical standards
- Providing resources for advice on ethics and compliance issues
- Having a means to report potential violations confidentially or anonymously
- Performing employee evaluations of ethical conduct
- Implementing a system to discipline violators

### Key Factors:
- **Workplace Diversity**: Modern workplaces include five generations, each with distinct expectations and understandings of ethics.
	- Traditionalists—born 1925 to 1945
	- Baby Boomers—born 1946 to 1964
	- Generation X—born 1965 to 1980
	- Millennials—born 1981 to 2000
	- Generation Z—born 2001 to 2020
	
- **Approaches to Ethical Behavior**:
  - **Intended (Projected) Behavior**: This includes the organization's purpose, values, and vision.
  - **Expressed Behavior**: This includes communications, training programs, and the tone set by leadership.
  - **Actual Behavior**: This reflects daily practices, observed behaviors, and employee perceptions.

Aligning these three behaviors is essential to establishing an effective and authentic ethical culture.

## Personality and Attitude
Personality is the total sum of ways in which an individual reacts to and interacts with others.
#### Influences on Personality:
- **Hereditary Factors**: Traits determined at conception, accounting for about 40% of personality.
- **Environmental Factors**: Experiences and social interactions that shape behavior, contributing to the remaining 60%.

### Components of Attitude:
Attitude can be broken into three interrelated components:

1. **Cognitive Component**  
   The belief or knowledge a person holds about a subject or individual.
2. **Affective Component**  
   The emotional reaction or feeling a person has toward a subject or individual.
3. **Behavioral Component**  
   The intention to act or behave in a certain way based on one's beliefs and emotions.

### Are Attitudes Contagious?
Attitudes can be influenced by social context and peer behavior. For example, subtle cues in how coworkers treat a specific individual can shape a new employee's perception of that person, even in the absence of direct information.

## Professional Misconduct
Professional misconduct is defined as the violation of rules or boundaries established by the governing body of a profession. It may range from minor to gross misconduct depending on severity and impact.

### Minor Misconduct:
- Persistent lateness
- Failure to complete assigned work on time
- Ignoring managerial instructions
- Completing work incorrectly
- Poor attendance management
- Failure to follow established procedures

### Gross Misconduct:
Gross misconduct is serious enough to damage or destroy the employer-employee relationship. Examples include:
- Theft or fraud
- Physical violence or bullying
- Serious property damage
- Misuse of company name or resources
- Accessing offensive or inappropriate online content
- Insubordination
- Discrimination or harassment
- Bringing disrepute to the organization
- Working under the influence of alcohol or drugs
- Serious negligence resulting in harm or loss
- Breach of health and safety regulations
- Breach of confidentiality

## Responses to Professional Misconduct
Employers typically respond to misconduct in structured ways:
- Verbal or written warnings for minor issues
- Formal investigations for serious allegations
- Disciplinary procedures, including possible suspension or termination, depending on severity
- Corrective training or counseling to prevent recurrence
