1. Propositions(Statements/Premises) - True හෝ False ලෙස වෙන් කරන්න පුලුවන් ප්‍රෙකාශන
2. Connectives/Operators
3. Logical equivalencies
4. Tautologies and Contradictions

## Propositions
---
* A proposition is the basic building block of logic.
* The truth or falsehood of a proposition is called its truth value.

## Connectives/Operators
---
- Connectives/operators are used for making compound propositions.
- There are binary and unary operators.

 1. Negation Operator ***(NOT)(~)***

- If 'P' a proposition, then the negative of 'P' is denoted by **(NOT)** has the opposite truth value of 'P'

Truth table for **NOT**


| **T** | **~T** |
|:-----:|:------:|
|   T   |    F   |
|   F   |    T   |

2. Conjunction Operator ***(AND)(^)***

Suppose : 
	P = "Paris is in France"
	L = "Landon is in Sri Lanka"


| P | L | P^L |
|:-:|:-:|:---:|
| T | T |  T  |
| T | F |  F  |
| F | T |  F  |
| F | F |  F  |
