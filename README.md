# üß† gaths-notes vault  
**LOOKING FOR CONTRIBUTORS**

Welcome to **gaths-notes**, a personal and **collaborative knowledge base** built with Obsidian. This repository contains well-organized academic notes designed for students following the **BICT program at the Faculty of Technology, University of Sri Jayewardenepura**. 

A website version of this vault generated with hugo is also available for easier browsing.

üåê **Website:** https://gatheesha.github.io/notes/

## Purpose
This project serves as a digital second brain ‚Äî a structured and detailed archive of notes and coursework.
- University coursework and notes for each module
- Productivity workflows using Obsidian, Hugo, Git, and CI integration with GitHub Actions

The goal is to create a high-quality, cross-linked resource for study, review, reference, and sharing.

## Contributing to Notes Vault
Pre-requisites: Markdown editor of your choice, [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is recommended and [Git](https://git-scm.com)

To contribute:

- Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gatheesha/gaths-notes.git
   ```

- Open the `content/` directory as an Obsidian vault.

   > (Still looking for a way to rename the vault internally without changing the folder name.)

- Follow the existing folder structure. Add new folders for new modules or update existing ones.

- Use Obsidian-flavored Markdown. Add YAML frontmatter if needed.

- Templates are available in the `templates/` directory:
   - `template-_index.md`: for module overview/index pages
   - `template-lecture.md`: for lecture note pages

- Ensure consistency in formatting, headings, and tags. Use Obsidian backlinks where helpful.

- Commit your changes and submit a pull request with a clear description.

> Notes should be fact-checked and cited if they are based on lectures, textbooks, or other academic sources.
